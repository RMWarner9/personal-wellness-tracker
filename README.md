# Personal Wellness Tracker
The personal wellness tracker application is a small application that allows a user to log and get a visual of their financial and emotional wellness.
The application uses a local, file-based database meaning that all data that the user enters is private. 

The user is able to log their finances, their mood, and a journal for the day.
